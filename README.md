## Why This Project?

### The Fundamental Problem with Current AI

Whether it's AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot), AI chat applications (ChatGPT, Claude), or AI roleplay platforms (SillyTavern), they all face the same underlying limitations:

| Problem                    | Current State                                                      | Consequence                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Limited context window** | Even 128K-1M tokens overflow in long conversations                 | Early messages get truncated; AI loses critical information |
| **Attention degradation**  | The longer the context, the less the model focuses on each segment | Even if information exists in context, AI may "overlook" it |
| **No persistent memory**   | Closing a conversation = forgetting everything                     | Every new session starts from zero                          |

### Our Solution

**Don't stuff all memories into the context. Let a dedicated AI retrieve them on demand.**

```
Traditional:  [All historical memory + current chat] → Single AI → Attention scattered
                              ↓
Our approach: [Index] → Retrieval AI (focused on finding) → [Selected memory + current chat] → Reply AI (focused on quality)
```

The Reply AI only sees **precisely filtered memory fragments** from the Retrieval AI. The context is clean, the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely high, and attention **never degrades**.

## Core Features

### 🧠 Original Layered Memory Algorithm

Designed after the human hippocampus memory formation mechanism and the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, achieving **theoretically unlimited AI memory**.

#### Three-Layer Memory Architecture

```
🔥 Hot Memory Layer — Injected every turn
   User profile / Permanent memories Top-100 / Pending tasks / Recent memories about user

🌤️ Warm Memory Layer — On-demand retrieval, last 30 days
   Daily summaries / Archived temporary memories / Monthly index

❄️ Cold Memory Layer — Deep retrieval, beyond 30 days
   Monthly summaries / Historical daily summaries / Yearly index
```

Additionally, an **L0 Memory Table Layer** (10 customizable tables, fully injected every turn as CSV) provides structured immediate context.

#### Key Metrics

| Metric                               | Value                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hot layer injection per turn         | **~7,000-11,000 tokens** (only 5-9% of a 128K window)                 |
| Retrieval AI context                 | **<5,000 tokens** (100% attention focused on retrieval)               |
| Storage cost                         | **Zero** (pure JSON files, no database dependency)                    |
| Single-character sustained operation | **12+ years** (at 5,000 files)                                        |
| Theoretical duration                 | **260+ years** (at 100,000 files; NTFS/ext4 support far exceeds this) |

#### Memory Decay Formula

```
score = weight × (1 / (1 + days_since_triggered × 0.1))
```

Inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve: important and recently triggered memories are prioritized for injection, rather than simple chronological order.

#### Pure Prompt-Driven — Zero Hardcoded Limitations

The most critical design feature of the memory system: **all memory injection, retrieval, archival, and summarization operations are performed by AI through prompts**, not traditional hardcoded logic.

This means:

- **Table meanings and purposes can be changed anytime**: Simply modify the prompt descriptions for tables, and the AI will interpret and operate them accordingly — no code changes needed
- **Archival strategies are instantly adjustable**: P2-P6 behaviors are entirely defined by prompts; modifying prompts changes archival rules, summary formats, and retrieval strategies
- **Zero technical barrier for migration**: Users can edit prompts themselves to adapt to different scenarios (roleplay / coding assistant / game NPC) without programming skills
- **Naturally avoids technical debt**: No complex parsers or state machines to maintain — the AI itself is the most flexible "parser"

### 🤖 Multi-AI Collaboration Engine

The system has **7 built-in AI roles**, each with a dedicated responsibility:

| AI                    | Role                                                                       | Trigger              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Chat AI               | Conversation with users, file operations                                   | User sends a message |
| P1 Retrieval AI       | Search relevant history from memory layers (up to 5 rounds of deep search) | Automatic per turn   |
| P2 Archive AI         | Summarize and archive when temporary memories exceed threshold             | Automatic            |
| P3 Daily Summary AI   | Generate detailed daily summary                                            | Manual               |
| P4 Hot→Warm AI        | Move expired hot-layer memories to warm layer                              | Manual               |
| P5 Monthly Summary AI | Warm→Cold archival, generate monthly summaries                             | Auto/Manual          |
| P6 Repair AI          | Check and fix memory file format issues                                    | Manual               |

Retrieval AI is recommended to use **Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash** (fast, low cost). Reply AI can use any model of your choice.

### 🖥️ IDE-Style Interface

VSCode-style three-panel layout:

- **Left panel**: Preset management / World book binding / Persona selection / Character editing
- **Center panel**: Chat / File editor / Memory management — three-tab switching
- **Right panel**: Character info / Feature toggles / Memory AI operation panel

### 🔌 11 Feature Plugins

Preset engine / Memory system / File operations / Desktop screenshot / Logger / Feature toggles / Multi-AI collaboration / Regex beautification / World book / Web search / System info

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support (i18n)

The management home page (beilu-home) supports 4 languages via a "translation overlay" approach — no restructuring of existing code, just adding `data-i18n` attributes to DOM elements for automatic translation.

| Code  | Language                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| zh-CN | Simplified Chinese (default)   |
| en-UK | English                        |
| ja-JP | 日本語 (Japanese)              |
| zh-TW | 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese) |

- Language preference auto-saved to `localStorage`, persists across refreshes
- Dynamic content (JS-generated text) translated via `t(key)` function
- Language switch triggers a `beilu-lang-change` event; all modules respond automatically

### 📦 SillyTavern Ecosystem Compatible

- Direct import of SillyTavern format character cards, presets, and world books
- Support for Risu formats (ccv3 / charx / rpack)
- 14 AI service generators (proxy / gemini / claude / ollama / grok, etc.)

## Thoughts on the Future of LLMs

Even when context windows expand to **10M+ tokens**, layered memory remains valuable:

1. **Attention problems won't disappear**: No matter how large the window, model attention on massive text will still degrade. Pre-filtering + precise injection will always outperform "stuff everything in."
2. **Cost efficiency**: Larger windows = higher costs. Replacing 100K+ tokens of full history with ~10K tokens of selected memory reduces API call costs by **10x or more**.
3. **Structured > Unstructured**: Tabular memory is easier for AI to accurately read and update than information scattered across conversations.

Layered memory is not a temporary workaround for limited context windows — it is a **superior paradigm for information organization**.

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/beilusaiying/always-accompany.git
cd always-accompany

# Launch (Windows)
run.bat

# Launch (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x run.sh
